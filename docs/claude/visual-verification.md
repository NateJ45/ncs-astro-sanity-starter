# Visual verification workflow

Moved out of CLAUDE.md. Read before reporting any UI change as done.

Every UI change is verified visually before being reported done. The build that ships first-time-right is the one where the person who wrote the code saw it rendering correctly in every state that matters. This is a rule, not a habit.

### What to verify

For any change touching components, layouts, styles, or copy that affects layout:

1. **Both themes.** Light AND dark. Toggle in the running site via the header `ThemeToggle`, or use Chrome DevTools' "Emulate CSS prefers-color-scheme" while testing system mode. Light is primary, but dark must read as the brand, not as broken.
2. **Both viewports.** Mobile (~375px wide) and desktop (~1280px wide). Most visitors arrive on mobile. Never ship desktop-only.
3. **Interactive states.** Hover, focus (keyboard Tab), active. Test with mouse AND keyboard.
4. **Adjacent regressions.** Look at the sections immediately before and after the change. Cascading styles wreck neighbors more often than expected.

### How to verify

Use the Playwright MCP for screenshot-and-compare loops:

1. `npm run dev` (or hit the deployed URL for deployed changes)
2. Open the page via Playwright MCP at both viewports
3. Take screenshots, light and dark
4. Compare against the intent (spec, mockup, or prior screenshot)
5. If something's off, fix and re-screenshot. Don't ship a change you haven't seen rendered.

For accessibility-affecting changes, run Lighthouse on the changed page before opening a PR. Targets: 100/100/100/100 desktop. Defend them — when a score drops, find out why before merging.

For Sanity Studio testing (schema or structure changes), run `npm run dev` and open `/studio` in a real browser with the console open. The Studio is the editor's UI; broken Studio = broken editor workflow, and a schema error passes the build and only surfaces at browser runtime.

### When NOT to skip this

Even "tiny" changes — a color tweak, a spacing nudge, a copy edit — go through the same loop. The smallest changes are where regressions hide because no one looks at them.
